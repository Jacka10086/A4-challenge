#Tidy Town
   
The Mayor of Anytown has requested that volunteers register for a "Tidy Town" project
which organises litter collection and general street maintenance. For ease of reporting, all volunteers are entered in the form "Surname, Firstname" and are maintained in alphabetical order.

  1.In your Anytown project, implement the class TidyTown which prompts the user to enter names until the name "xxx" (which should not be stored) is entered.
    
  2.﻿﻿﻿The names should be stored in either an ArrayList or LinkedList structure (your choice!)
    
  ﻿﻿﻿3.Each name entered should be added to the structure such that the list of names is always maintained in alphabetical order.
       
  4.﻿﻿﻿Once the "xxx" value has been entered, the list of names should be displayed alphabetically by traversing the list structure.
